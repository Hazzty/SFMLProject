# SFMLProject

As the name hints, this project is a made using SFML, a game library for C++. 
It was made as a final project for one of my courses in object oriented C++ programming.

In the game you play as a character being viciously assaulted by geometrical shapes and your goal as a player is to neutralize these threats before they reach, and inevitably kill you.
